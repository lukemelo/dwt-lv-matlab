Welcome to the waveform processing toolbox. Information on each dwt_"function" can be found in their respective files. 

Run "spectra_processing_hub.mat" to process your spectra. Data must be imported to a row matrix. 

The order you process the data DOES MATTER. The order suggested in "spectra_processing_hub.mat" seems to give the best results.

Good luck with the waveform toolbox.

If you would like to process each spectra separately, let:
local = true
